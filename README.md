# static-electricity

FP library with rich static-land support.

## Features

* Useful general-purpose structures like linked lists and `Maybe`
* `static-land` modules for easy abstraction
  * `Auto` module for when you don't want to explicitly pass around modules
* Abstracted functions like `map` or `equals`
  * "`<abstraction>$`" versions of those functions that explicitly take a module

## Installation

```
npm install static-electricity
```
